## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
- Basic knowledge of C programming.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rough-works-c.git
   \`\`\`

2. Change into the project directory:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd rough-works-c
   \`\`\`

Now you're ready to start experimenting with C programming in this workspace.

## Usage

Feel free to create, modify, and organize your C code files and projects within this repository. Here are some guidelines for usage:

1. **Organize Your Work**: Create meaningful directories and subdirectories to categorize your projects or experiments. For example:

   \`\`\`
   /projects
       /data-structures
       /algorithms
   /experiments
       /file-io
       /memory-management
   \`\`\`

2. **Documentation**: Include a \`README.md\` file in each project or experiment directory to explain its purpose, how to use it, and any other relevant information.

3. **Version Control**: Use Git to track your changes and collaborate with others if desired. Regularly commit your work and push it to the repository.

4. **Comments and Documentation**: Provide comments within your code to explain your thought process and the functionality of the code. This will make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand your work.

5. **Testing**: Test your code thoroughly, especially if it's intended to solve a specific problem or demonstrate a concept. Include test cases and instructions on how to run them if applicable.

6. **Collaboration**: If you're open to collaboration or seeking feedback, create issues and pull requests to facilitate communication and contributions from others.

7. **Learning**: Use this repository as a learning tool. Experiment with new concepts, algorithms, and data structures. Learn from your own code and from others who may contribute.
